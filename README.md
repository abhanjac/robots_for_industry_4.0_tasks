Project is focused towards incorporating this technology into a drone for assisting it to open the door in air autonomously. 
Drones are being used extensively for surveillance and reconnaissance tasks.
But in the recent past they are also being employed for interacting physically with the environment.
This can involve tasks like picking up packages or boxes, mounting some sensor on a wall or opening doors while hovering.
Several sophisticated end effectors have also been designed for this purpose. 
But for all of them to work the drone needs to identify the target object in front of it.
So the focus of this project is to identify an electrical panel box and its handle and measure the distance of the drone from it.
This information will be later used (in a separate project) by the drone for controlling its position and the movement of its end effector to grab the box handle and pull open the box.

This project is only about the image processing part to identify and electrical panel box. 
The camera to be used should be small and light, so that it can be put on a drone. So we selected the Intel Realsense Depth camera for this purpose.

# Requirements: 
* Algorithm should be able to run in real time on a laptop as well as on a sigle board computer (without any dependence on GPUs).
* Algorithm should be able to detect the electrical panel box and show the position of the box handle.
* The distance of the box handle from the camera should also be calculated continuously in real time.
* All software should be open source. 
* Overall setup should be battery operated and should be small and light enough to be mounted on a drone. 

# Current Framework: 
* Opencv, SciKit Learn and SciKit Image libraries, Ubuntu 16.04. 
* Intel Realsense R200 Depth Camera.
* Odroid XU4 single board computer, Laptop computer.

#### Overall Setup mounted on the test Drone:
**[ Odroid is inside the white case ]**

The next figure shows the **electrical panel box** mounted on a dummy wall in the lab. 
The figure also shows the **yellow claws with fingers** to grab the box handle. 
This will be later attached to the drone. For now it is only mounted on a stand so that the overall setup looks like a real image as seen by the realsense camera.
The claws will be visible from one side of the frame, as it is supposed to be mounted on one arm of the drone.

[ **NOTE:** All of the figures of the electrical panel door has a green circle patch beside it. But this patch is not used in any of the image processing that we do in this project.
This patch was made for an earlier experiment and was still kept there as it might be used later as well. But it has nothing to do with the task that is discussed here. ]

# Algorithm for Detecting the Box: 
The algorithm goes through several stages for detecting the box.

### Stage 1:
The videos from the realsense is read as a numpy array. This included both the **rgb frame** as well as the depth frame.
The **depth frame** is of the same dimension as the rgb frame (640 x 480 pixels) but each pixel in the frame has a value equal to the distance of the object represented by that pixel from the camera in mm.

### Stage 2:
When the box is nearer to the camera, the claws will be obstructing parts of the box. But it is already known at which pixels the claws are visible.
So the pixels for the claws are replaced by the other surrounding background pixels to that the overall frame has no visible claws and only the box and the background are visible. 
The following figure shows the **original frame** (left) and the processed frame with the claws removed. This frame will be used for further processing. This frame will be referred to as **modified rgb frame** (right) from now onwards.

![original_rgb_frame](images/original_rgb_frame.png)
![modified_rgb_frame1](images/modified_rgb_frame1.png)

### Stage 3:
The modified rgb frames from stage 2, (claws removed) are then subjected to edge detection and all the contours from these edges are found out. This **contour frame** (top right) is shown below.
These contours are then filtered based on their size and area so that most of the unwanted contours get removed. This will be called **filtered contour frame** (bottom left).
This filtered contour frame is also shown which includes the contour of the box and some other similar contours. These contours are then drawn as filled blocks in a new frame to create a mask.
This will be called **contour mask** (bottom right).

![modified_rgb_frame](images/modified_rgb_frame.png)
![contour_frame](images/contour_frame.png)

![filtered_contour_frame](images/filtered_contour_frame.png)
![contour_mask](images/contour_mask.png)

However, the size of this box contour will not stay fixed. It will change depending on the distance of the box from the camera.
So the size and area filters applied to the contour frame cannot have a fixed threshold, but has to be a range.

### Stage 4:
After this, the modified rgb frame is filtered with a color filter, so that only the objects which are within a range of color, remains visible.
This **color mask** (left) is shown below. This color mask is then combined with the contour mask created earlier in stage 3 to remove the last remaining unwanted contours. 
This creates the **final contour frame** (right) shown below.

![color_mask](images/color_mask.png)
![final_contour_frame](images/final_contour_frame.png)

This two stage detection (with contour mask and color mask) is done to make the algorithm robust. 
Sometimes with only contour dectection, often the adjacent contours gets merged which makes the overall contour of the box, include parts of other adjacent objects or backgrounds as well.
Hence, to prevent that the color mask filter is also used on top of it.

### Creating an Support Vector Machine model for the Box:
This final contour frame is used as a mask to crop out parts of the original rgb frame. The **Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG)** features are then extracted from all of these cropped out parts.
These HOG features are then used to create a positive training set for a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**. 
Negative examples are generated from some of the other unwanted contour HOG features. Then model is also trained with other negetive examples collected from environments outside the lab.
A **Hard Negative Mining** is also performed with some of the difficult negetive examples to make the overall model more robust.
The images below shows the **cropped out portions** (left) and the modified rgb frame and the **HOG features** (right) extracted from them, which will be used to train the SVM.
The HOG features helps to identify the texture of the box. It gives an idea of its shape.

![cropped_image](images/cropped_image.png)
![hog_feature](images/hog_feature.png)

This stage is not executed during the real time execution of the box detection code. 
It is only done once at the beginning to create the SVM model from the training data. This SVM model is saved as [model.p](codes/model.p).

#### Procedure for creating the SVM model:
The [svm_data.tar.gz](codes/svm_data.tar.gz) file has to be extacted. This will create have a **train** and a **test** directory.
The train directory has 117 positive examples of the box and 296 negative examples (all are cropped images like the ones shown above).
The [train_svm.py](codes/train_svm.py) script has to be run to create the [model.p](codes/model.p) file.

However an already created [model.p](codes/model.p) is present in this repository (which is an already trained SVM model) which can also be used.

### Stage 5:
The HOG features from the final contour found in stage 4 are extracted and fed to this SVM model found in the file [model.p](codes/model.p).
If the final contour really represents the box, then the output of the model should be **True** else **False**.
So if the model output is True, then it is confirmed that the box is detected.
Use of the SVM ensures that there are no false detections or unwanted contours left behind in the final contour frame.

# Finding the Distance of the Box:
Once the final box contour is found, a **rotated rectangle** ( **cyan** in color ) is drawn around it as shown in the **final detection frame**.
The position of the handle of the box is inferred from this bounding rectangle.
Since the corner vertices and angle of tilt of the rectangle is known, a rotation matrix transformation is able to find the exact loaction of the box handle.
This is marked by the **purple dot** inside the bounding rectangle. The detected box and the handle are shown below.

![final_detection_frame](images/final_detection_frame.png)

Now, the Realsense R200 gives a good measure of the distance in a range of **0.5 mm to 2 mm**. 
So, in this code if the distance of the camera from the box is **beyond 1.5 mm** the distance is estimated using the approximate focal length of the **rgb camera**.

The approximate focal length is found out based on the assumption that the size of the object will be the same as the size of its image, if the object is at the focal length of the camera.

**Focal Length (F) = Object Distance (D) x Image Size (P) / Object Size (W)**

Within **0.5 mm and 1.5 mm** the distance is measured using the **depth image**.
The value of every pixels of the region of the frame where the final contour was detected is taken into account and a historgram of these values is created.
This is because there may be a few values that may be from the pixels which actually belong to the background. 
Also there may be some fluctuations in the depth frame as well, which may lead to some sudden 0 values for some pixels even if they belong to the box contour.
But these erronous pixels are not very large in number. 
So if a historgram of the number of pixels at different distance values, is created, then it is seen that the majority of the pixels are belonging to the bin that gives the correct distance of the box.
Hence, this distance corresponding to the group of majority of the pixels is considered as the detected distance of the box.
An image of such a historgram is shown below. It shows the peak as well which belongs bin that represents the actual distance of the box.

![distance_histogram](images/distance_histogram.png)

**Below 0.5 mm** however, there is no proper way to measure the distance solely based on rgb or depth image. 
The final contour of the box becomes bigger than the frame size itself and the depth frame values are also not usable.
So in such a position the drone either has to move blindly or has to use some other sensor like sonar etc.
But this is not much of a problem as in the final configuration the drone will have the claws mounted on a front rod or boom, which will be around 0.4 m anyways.
So the camera is at 0.5 m from the box will imply that the claws are at only 0.1 m from the box, which is a very short distance. 
Hence, moving blindly in this short distance is not a problem.

The final distances **in meters** measured is also displayed on the final detected frame. 
This distance show how much the camera or the drone has to be moved so that the **red crosshairs** drawn on the frame will merge with the **purple dot** showing the position of the handle.
**X axis** is directed **Outward** from the plane of the frame (towards the viewer).
**Y axis** is directed to the **Left**.
**Z axis** is directed **Upwards**.

# Results:
There is a video file that can be used to test the output the algorithm.
The raw video file, a recorded video showing the final detection is present in the [videos](videos) directory.

The output [detection_video](videos/detection_video.avi) is recorded by running the algorithm on the [raw_input_video](videos/raw_input_video.avi) file.

The detection video can also be found on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) at the following link:

* [combined video for box detection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSGtvHl_pHU)

A gif showing a glimpse of the box detection is also shown below.

This algorithm ran on the Odroid XU4 in real time at **14 Hz**.

# Observations:
* It can be seen that if the box is too near to the camera, (which is within 0.5 m) the box is not detected. This is because of the range limitation of the depth camera and the incapability of measuring the distance using rgb image at this close distance.
* Even if the claws obstruct the box to some extent, it can still be detected. This is because the processing is based on the modified rgb frame that cloaks the claws. But the detection flickers if the claws obstruct the box too much.
* Other than these two cases the detection is pretty stable and robust.
* Algorithm was able to run on the Odroid in real time at **14 Hz**

# Future Work:
Future work will include using the distance measured from this algorithm to be used to modulate the movement of the drone.
The drone is controlled using the **Robot Operating System (ROS)** which will take this **box detected** signal and the subsequent distance measurement as an input and try to perform the task of opening the box by the handle.
